# SoftwareDevIdle

<s>This is a fairly simple Idle style game I wrote in about a week. It's the first "idle" I've created, so there's probably some "weirdness" to the gameplay.</s>

Ok, so lets start over. That was 4 years ago and I've put about another 2-3 weeks into this project. This may still not win any major awards for complexity, but it's not as simple as it was.

I've added several more application types to buy, as well as more defences/multipliers and attacks. I've also added Achievements, fixed bugs, made the credits go to a much higher value before winning, spit the JS into separate files and classes, and added a lot of other details that are less interesting, but still useful to the UI/UX and gameplay.

I've played quite a few "idle" games and decided to try my hand at it. I also decided to add a few "new" mechanics to it, including loans and a 2nd layer of "idle"-ness in the form of "Multipliers".

There's no offline mode and no way to save your progress.

I posted this on 2 different casual gaming sites as well as my own website. With the new functionality, I'm going to post it on more gaming sites. Once I add an advertising API, I'm going to try to make some money off these websites. Who knows it it'll work, but maybe.

One of the big things I've done is add unit testing. I'm not done and I'm going to add integration testing. I've built my own vanilla JavaScript testing framework, which is in a different GitHub repo.
