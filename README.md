# SoftwareDevIdle

This is a fairly simple Idle style game I wrote in about a week. It's the first "idle" I've created, so there's probably some "weirdness" to the gameplay.

I've played quite a few "idle" games and decided to try my hand at it. I also decided to add a few "new" mechanics to it, including loans and a 2nd layer of "idle"-ness in the form of "Multipliers".

There's no offline mode and no way to save your progress.

I posted this on 2 different casual gaming sites as well as my own website.
